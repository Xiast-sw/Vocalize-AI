# Vocalize AI: Audio Recognition and Classification Project

**Vocalize AI** is an audio recognition and classification application developed using TensorFlow and Keras. This project offers the ability to recognize voice commands, classify environmental sounds, and perform various audio analyses. The model, trained with the **UrbanSound8K** dataset, is designed to classify different sounds commonly heard in urban environments.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Receives audio input and converts spoken words into text.
- **Sound Classification**: Categorizes different environmental sounds (e.g., barking, drilling, car horn, etc.).
- **Customizable Model**: Configurable model architecture on TensorFlow and Keras, adaptable to various datasets.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes audio input in real-time with suitable hardware.

## Dataset

This project uses the **UrbanSound8K** dataset to identify and classify urban sounds. The dataset contains 8,732 audio clips divided into the following 10 sound categories:

1. **Dog Bark** (dog_bark)
2. **Children Playing** (children_playing)
3. **Drilling** (drilling)
4. **Engine Idling** (engine_idling)
5. **Gun Shot** (gun_shot)
6. **Jackhammer** (jackhammer)
7. **Siren** (siren)
8. **Air Conditioner** (air_conditioner)
9. **Car Horn** (car_horn)
10. **Street Music** (street_music)
